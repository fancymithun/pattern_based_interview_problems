1. ### How to deploy react.js application on google cloud run along with dockerfile.

To deploy a React.js project along with a Docker container to Google Cloud Run, you'll need to follow these steps:

Create a Docker Image: Start by creating a Docker image that packages your React.js application. The Docker image should include the necessary dependencies and build your React.js project. Your Dockerfile might look something like this:

```dockerfile

# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire application code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the React.js project
RUN npm run build

# Set the command to start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]


```

Build and Push the Docker Image: Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile and tag it with the appropriate Google Cloud Run registry URL. Push the image to the Google Container Registry (GCR):

```bash

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name> .

# Push the Docker image to GCR
docker push gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name>

```

Replace <project_id> with your Google Cloud project ID, and <image_name> with a name for your Docker image.

Enable Google Cloud Run: Make sure that Google Cloud Run is enabled for your Google Cloud project. If it's not already enabled, enable it from the Google Cloud Console or using the gcloud command-line tool.

Deploy to Google Cloud Run: Deploy the Docker image to Google Cloud Run using the gcloud run deploy command:

```bash

gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name> --platform managed --region <region>

```

Replace <project_id> with your Google Cloud project ID, <image_name> with the name of your Docker image, and <region> with the desired region where you want to deploy your application.

Configure and Test: During the deployment process, you may be asked to configure various options, such as the service name and authentication settings. Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a URL endpoint for your React.js application.

Access the React.js Application: Your React.js application is now accessible at the provided URL endpoint. You can open the URL in a web browser to access your deployed React.js application.

Google Cloud Run automatically scales the container instances up and down based on incoming traffic, providing you with a fully managed and scalable serverless environment to run your React.js application.

Remember that Cloud Run is designed for stateless HTTP workloads, and your React.js application should not rely on local file storage. For any persistent data storage requirements, consider using other Google Cloud services like Google Cloud Storage or a backend API connected to a database.

2. ### How to deploy react.js application on google app engine along with dockerfile

To deploy a React.js application on Google App Engine along with a Dockerfile, follow these steps:

Create a Docker Image: Start by creating a Dockerfile that packages your React.js application. The Dockerfile should include the necessary dependencies and build your React.js project. Your Dockerfile might look something like this:

```dockerfile

# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire application code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the React.js project
RUN npm run build

# Install serve to serve the static files
RUN npm install -g serve

# Set the command to serve the built React.js application
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build"]


```

Build and Push the Docker Image: Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile and tag it with the appropriate Google Cloud Registry URL. Push the image to the Google Container Registry (GCR):

```bash

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name> .

# Push the Docker image to GCR
docker push gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name>

```

Replace <project_id> with your Google Cloud project ID, and <image_name> with a name for your Docker image.

Enable Google App Engine: Make sure that Google App Engine is enabled for your Google Cloud project. If it's not already enabled, enable it from the Google Cloud Console or using the gcloud command-line tool.

Create an app.yaml Configuration File: In your project's root directory, create an app.yaml file. This file will contain the configuration for deploying your React.js application using the Docker container.

Here's a sample app.yaml:

```yml

runtime: custom
env: flex

manual_scaling:
  instances: 1

resources:
  cpu: 1
  memory_gb: 0.5
  disk_size_gb: 10

entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app


```

Deploy to Google App Engine: Deploy the Docker image to Google App Engine using the gcloud app deploy command:

```bash

gcloud app deploy

```

During the deployment process, you may be asked to configure various options, such as the service name and region. Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a URL endpoint for your React.js application.

Access the React.js Application: Your React.js application is now deployed on Google App Engine and accessible at the provided URL endpoint. You can open the URL in a web browser to access your deployed React.js application.
Google App Engine provides a fully managed platform for running applications, and it will handle the scaling and execution of your Docker container to serve your React.js application.

Please note that when using Google App Engine, you do not need to specify the port as Google App Engine handles it automatically. Also, consider using Cloud Storage or other external services for persistent data storage if your React.js application requires it.
